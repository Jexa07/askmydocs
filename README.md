# 🧠 AskAnyDoc — Smart Q&A from Your Own Documents

AskAnyDoc is a lightweight RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that lets you upload documents (CSV, TXT) and ask natural-language questions. It uses document embeddings + a generative LLM (like OpenAI GPT-3.5) to give intelligent, context-aware answers, just like ChatGPT, but for your files.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 Upload any CSV or TXT file — instantly processed
- 🔍 Vector search using FAISS for fast chunk retrieval
- 🧠 Embeddings powered by `MiniLM` (blazing fast)
- 💬 Answers generated by OpenAI GPT-3.5 (or your favorite LLM)
- 🖼️ Simple and clean Streamlit UI
- 🔓 100% local, open-source, customizable

---

## 📂 Example Use Cases

- 🔍 "What are the most common issues reported in this CSV?"
- 📈 "Summarize the findings from this data export."
- 🗂️ "What does this document say about product performance?"

## 🧪 How It Works

1. You upload a CSV or TXT file
2. The content is split into chunks and embedded
3. The vector index (FAISS) is built on-the-fly
4. Your question is embedded and matched with relevant chunks
5. The matched chunks + your question are passed to the LLM
6. The LLM responds with a smart, context-aware answer

## 🧾 Supported File Types (For Now)

✅ CSV
✅ TXT

> Want to support PDFs and DOCX? Coming soon in next version!

## 🔒 Privacy

All processing is done locally. No document is sent to OpenAI — only selected relevant chunks used for response generation.

---

## 💡 Ideas for Next Version

* [ ] Add support for PDF and DOCX files
* [ ] Claude/Gemini model fallback
* [ ] Local LLMs with Transformers + BitsAndBytes
* [ ] Conversation memory and chat history
